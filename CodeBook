# CodeBook for Getting and Cleaning Data Project  

## **Dataset Description**  
The dataset used in this project comes from the accelerometers of the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. It contains data collected from 30 volunteers performing six activities while wearing a smartphone on their waist.

**Original Data Source:**  
- [UCI Machine Learning Repository: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

## **Data Collection Process**  
1. The data was downloaded and extracted from the given URL.
2. The training and test datasets were loaded into R.
3. The subject, activity, and feature datasets were merged into one dataset.
4. Measurements on the mean and standard deviation were extracted.
5. Activity labels were replaced with descriptive names.
6. Variable names were updated to be more descriptive.
7. A second tidy dataset was created with the average of each variable for each subject and activity.

## **Variables in `tidy_data.txt`**  
Each row represents a **subject** performing a specific **activity**, with the average of each measurement.

### **Identifiers:**
- `subject` - The ID of the participant (1 to 30)
- `activity` - The name of the performed activity

### **Extracted Measurements (Mean & Standard Deviation Only):**
- `TimeBodyAccelerometer-mean-X`
- `TimeBodyAccelerometer-mean-Y`
- `TimeBodyAccelerometer-mean-Z`
- `TimeBodyAccelerometer-std-X`
- `TimeBodyAccelerometer-std-Y`
- `TimeBodyAccelerometer-std-Z`
- `TimeGravityAccelerometer-mean-X`
- `TimeGravityAccelerometer-mean-Y`
- `TimeGravityAccelerometer-mean-Z`
- ... (Other mean and std measurements from accelerometers & gyroscopes)

> The full dataset contains **66** measurement columns, focusing only on **mean** and **standard deviation** values.

---

## **Transformations & Processing**
- **Merged** training (`X_train.txt`) and test (`X_test.txt`) datasets.
- **Extracted** only mean and standard deviation columns using `grep()`.
- **Used descriptive activity names** from `activity_labels.txt`.
- **Renamed variables** to be more human-readable:
  - `tBodyAcc-mean()-X` → `TimeBodyAccelerometer-mean-X`
  - `fBodyGyro-std()-Y` → `FrequencyBodyGyroscope-std-Y`
  - `tGravityAcc-std()-Z` → `TimeGravityAccelerometer-std-Z`
- **Grouped data** by `subject` and `activity`, then calculated the **average** of each measurement.

---

## **Final Output (`tidy_data.txt`)**
- The dataset is stored as a **text file** with **180 rows** and **68 columns** (1 subject column, 1 activity column, 66 measurements).
- The values are **averages of the mean and standard deviation measurements** per subject and activity.

## **How to Use the Data**
To read `tidy_data.txt` in R:

```r
tidy_data <- read.table("tidy_data.txt", header = TRUE)
View(tidy_data)
